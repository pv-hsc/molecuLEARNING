# molecuLEARNING

molecuLEARNING is a proof-of-concept (recurrent) neural network model that can predict the energetics of complex materials based on a simple SMILe representation of the same.

The model is based on a combination of 1D convolutional and LSTM layers, and relies on a simple encoding of input molecules using a fixed alphabet of chemical structure symbols.

This proof-of-concept relies on data from two existing datasets, namely the QM9[1] and HOPV[2] datasets
